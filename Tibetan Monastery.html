            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Manali Gompa, which is also known as Gadhan Thekchhokling Gompa, is a Buddhist monastery in Manali, Himachal Pradesh. Dedicated to Lord Buddha, this monastery was built in 1960 by refugees from Tibet. Today, this peaceful place of worship is an important religious center for Buddhists.

It receives a large number of devotees from Nepal, Tibet and parts of Himachal Pradesh like Spiti and Kinnaur. Since people of all religious beliefs are allowed into the monastery, many non-Buddhists, especially tourists can be seen here sitting and meditating in its tranquil environs.

The monastery has a traditional Tibetan architecture featuring a yellow pagoda-style roof with a traditional tiered tower. One of the highlights of this monastery is a huge statue of Lord Buddha, which has been installed in its main sanctum.</p>
